**WARNING- NOT PROD (yet), no releases, if you use this you are running with scissors ...**  

Red Hat Product Security CLI providing:

* Set of entity operations on flaws, affects, components, products, etc... for 
searching, listing and retrieving entities.
* Set of service operations answering 'canned' product security related queries
and automating away manual 'drudgery'
* Dynamic, extensible set of custom plugin operations for interacting with external services 

The CLI provides a simple 'facade' over coarse grained security related data services allowing 
for easier aggregation and narrowing of information providing a good security 'signal' 
for end users.
