Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project is kept in version sync with the Component Registry project, see the version policy and thus a lot of versions don't bring ground breaking changes and they rather update the API endpoints. In such cases the version is listed without any additions/changes/deletions.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.
